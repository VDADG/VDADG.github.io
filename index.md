title: Deep Visual Similarity and Metric Learning
rank: 3
---

Learning about visual similarity is crucial for a wide range of vision tasks, such as image clustering, face detection or image retrieval, thus laying the basis for everyday applications
like smart arrangement of image collections on our smartphones, web-scale image search in our browser or recommending products while shopping online. Today, the predominant approach for
learning visual representations that capture similarity is Deep Metric Learning, which specifically aims at retrieving objects and images from novel, unseen classes. Moreover, similarity
learning is closely related to contrastive learning, which is the leading approach to self-supervised learning, respectively transfer learning.

In this tutorial we will provide an in-depth coverage of the leading learning paradigms for Deep Metric Learning (DML) and also future directions of how to realistically evaluate their
(out-of-distribution) generalization. Specifically, the tutorial will cover the following subjects: <i>(i)</i> the landscape of DML objective functions, <i>(ii)</i> advanced and contextual
DML formulations, <i>(iii)</i> the importance of data sampling in DML, <i>(iv)</i> best practices for fair and realistic evaluation of DML methods and finally, <i>(v)</i> we draw connections
from DML to related fields in computer vision and pattern recognition, such as contrastive learning, few-shot learning, transfer learning and face recognition.
